It is a\nseries of individual styles, components, and guidelines used for creating\nunified product experiences.\n\nTo learn more about how we work check out\n[What is Carbon](/all-about-carbon/what-is-carbon).\n\n### Who works on Carbon?\n\nCarbon has a core team of designers and front-end developers dedicated to\ndeveloping and supporting the system. There are also countless other designers\nand developers who contribute back to\n[carbon-react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon#contributors).\n\n## Contributing\n\n### How can I contribute and/or propose new components or ideas?\n\nCheck out our [contribution get started](/contributing/get-started) page to\nlearn all about the different ways to contribute. Thanks for the help!\n\n### I see a bug. How do I report it?\n\nFirst, make sure the problem is reproducible. Once confirmed, open an issue in\nthe appropriate GitHub repo from the following list. We will address the bug as\nsoon as we can. If you have a fix for the bug, please feel free to submit a PR\nfor it.\n\nFor larger changes, please see our\n[contribution get started](/contributing/get-started) page.\n\n#### Design issue repos\n\n- [Design kit](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-design-kit/issues/new)\n- [Icons](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-icons/issues/new)\n- [Website](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new/choose)\n- [Components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [Elements](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [Charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/new)\n- [Everything else](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n\n#### Code repos\n\n- [@carbon/react](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [@carbon/web-components](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-for-ibm-dotcom/issues/new/choose)\n- [carbon-components-angular](https://github.com/IBM/carbon-components-angular/issues/new)\n- [carbon-components-vanilla](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\n- [carbon-components-vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue/issues/new)\n- [carbon-charts](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-charts/issues/new)\n\n### What can I expect for a response to my bug report?\n\nIf you have a pressing bug or change it is best to make a PR for the issue\nyourself. Our team works in sprints and will try to address your bug as soon as\npossible; sometimes within two or three days, but usually by the following\nsprint. Issues that are out of scope will be closed until they become a higher\npriority.\n\nTypical responses to bug reports will include:\n\n- Need more info, can't reproduce the problem\n- Won't fix, this isn't something we intend to support\n- Confirmed, will add to our roadmap (Carbon team will fix)\n- Confirmed, will accept PRs (need external member to fix)\n- Need to include design to verify this behavior is supported\n\n### What should I do if I find a component that isn't accessible?\n\nFirst, refer to the\n[Carbon accessibility guidelines](/guidelines/accessibility/overview) to confirm\nthat the component fails accessibility standards. If confirmed,\n[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new/choose)\nin the Components repo and describe the steps to reproduce the problem. If the\ncore Carbon team confirms the problem, we will work to fix it as quickly as\npossible.\n\n## Creating with Carbon\n\n### Which browsers are supported?\n\nCarbon components are supported in the following browsers:\n\n- Microsoft Edge latest\n- Firefox latest\n- Chrome latest\n- Safari latest\n\nFor IBM teams, see\n[browser support standards here](https://w3.ibm.com/w3publisher/ibm-web-standards-external/standards-mandatory/browser-standards).\n\n### What languages are the components written in?\n\nCarbon is built React first, with official support for Web Components. There is\ncommunity support for vanilla JS, Angular, Vue, and Svelte implementations.\nCheck out [Frameworks](/developing/frameworks/react) to learn more about what\nyou need to get started with Carbon implementations.\n\n### Where do I find mobile components?\n\nThe Carbon Native mobile Figma kit is available on the\n[Other resources](https://carbondesignsystem.com/designing/design-resources/#native-mobile)\npage.\n\n### Where do I find the Experimental components and patterns?\n\nThe patterns and components that were in Experimental are now in the\n[Community assets](/community/overview) section. Community assets include work\ndeveloped and maintained by the individuals and teams who use Carbon. You can\nhelp elevate these resources by contributing feedback, code, and design.\n\nNote that some of the content in Community assets is hosted on internal IBM\nsites and is only accessible to IBMers.\n\n### Where do I find charts and data visualization?\n\nCarbon charts and their corresponding assets and documentation are now in the\n[Data visualization](/data-visualization/getting-started) section.\n\n### Where can I find documentation for earlier versions of Carbon?\n\nYou can find earlier versions of Carbon documentation here:\n**[V6](http://v6.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V7](http://v7.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V8](http://v8.carbondesignsystem.com/)**,\n**[V9](http://v9.carbondesignsystem.com/)**, and\n**[V10](http://v10.carbondesignsystem.com/).**\n\n## Telemetry\n\nCarbon contains a telemetry feature that collects usage information for IBM and\nCarbon Design System properties.\n\n### Why is telemetry collected?\n\nCarbon collects telemetry information to influence Carbon's roadmap and\nprioritize bug fixes.\n\n### When is data collected?\n\nData is only collected when Carbon packages are installed on a Continuous\nIntegration (CI) server, when the installation is not part of a Pull Request\n(PR), and for Git repositories with the origin remotes:\n\n- `github.ibm.com`\n- `github.com/ibm`\n- `github.com/carbon-design-system`\n\nAs the information collected is not anonymous, telemetry data collection is\nlimited to IBM GitHub Enterprise repositories, as well as open source\nrepositories in the IBM and Carbon Design System GitHub organizations.\n\n### What is being collected?\n\nThe following is collected through a postinstall script:\n\n- Git repository remote origin URLs and commit hashes\n- Packages and package versions used in the repository\n- Components being used including file paths and their packages\n- Component props being used (the prop value is only collected when it is\n  serializable to a string)\n\n### How do I opt out?\n\nParticipation in Carbon's telemetry is optional.
